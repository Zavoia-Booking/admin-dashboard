Features: auth, calendar, services, team members, locations, marketplace, customers, bundles, categories, settings, business setup wizard.

# ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS

## Redux State Management
- Use `typesafe-actions` for all actions: `createAction`, `createAsyncAction`
- Async actions follow REQUEST/SUCCESS/FAILURE pattern:
  ```ts
  export const myAction = createAsyncAction(
    'FEATURE/ACTION/REQUEST',
    'FEATURE/ACTION/SUCCESS', 
    'FEATURE/ACTION/FAILURE'
  )<RequestPayload, SuccessPayload, ErrorPayload>();
  ```
- Simple actions: `createAction('FEATURE/ACTION')<Payload>()`

## Redux Saga
- Use `call`, `put`, `select`, `takeLatest`, `all` from redux-saga/effects
- Handler functions: `function* handleAction(action: ActionType<typeof myAction.request>) {...}`
- Export single saga per feature: `export function* featureSaga() { yield all([...]) }`
- Register in `src/app/providers/sagas.ts`

## Selectors
- Use `createSelector` from @reduxjs/toolkit
- Base selectors in `src/app/providers/selectors.ts`: `getFeatureStateSelector`
- Feature selectors derive from base: `createSelector(getFeatureStateSelector, (state) => state.field)`

## Reducers
- Use `getType(actions.myAction)` in switch statements
- Handler functions: `const handleMyAction = (state, payload) => ({...state, field: payload})`
- Type actions as `ActionType<typeof actions>`

## API Layer
- Use `apiClient()` from `src/shared/lib/http.ts`
- Pattern: `const { data } = await apiClient().post<Type>('/endpoint', payload)`

## Feature Structure
Each feature in `src/features/[name]/` must have:
- actions.ts, saga.ts, reducer.ts, selectors.ts, types.ts, api.ts
- components/, pages/ folders

## Components
- Wrap pages in `<AppLayout>`, `<BusinessSetupGate>`, `<AccessGuard>`
- Use `useDispatch`, `useSelector` from react-redux
- Dispatch actions: `dispatch(myAction.request(payload))`

# STYLING

## TailwindCSS Theme System
- Use semantic CSS variables, NOT raw colors
- Light/dark mode: `:root` for light, `.dark` for dark overrides
- Key variables: `--surface`, `--base`, `--text-primary`, `--border`, `--primary`
- Tailwind utilities map to variables: `bg-surface`, `text-foreground-1`, `border-border`

## Status Colors
- Info: `bg-info-bg`, `border-info-border`, `text-info`
- Success: `bg-success-bg`, `border-success-border`, `text-success`
- Warning: `bg-warning-bg`, `border-warning-border`, `text-warning`
- Error: `bg-error-bg`, `border-error-border`, `text-error`

## UI Components
- Use Radix UI primitives from `src/shared/components/ui/`
- Button variants: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link, info
- Forms: use field components from `src/shared/components/forms/fields/`
